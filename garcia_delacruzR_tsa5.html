            <p class="desc">Freddy is a brown animatronic bear and the star attraction of the original Freddy Fazbear's
                Pizza, as well as the face and namesake of the company that owns it– Fazbear Entertainment. Freddy takes
                the role of lead singer and overall performer of the band, standing in the center of the stage.
                Undisclosed to Fazbear Entertainment and the public, Freddy is possessed by the restless spirit of
                Gabriel – a little boy murdered by William Afton. Due to this, Freddy and his likewise possessed
                bandmates are now seeking revenge against their common killer by attacking any similar-looking adults in
                the pizzeria after hours in a blind rage, not knowing that they, the children, are being manipulated by
                William Afton. However, Freddy is evidently friendly towards children and seeks to save his and his
                friends' own souls as well as any other children targeted by William Afton.

                are now seeking revenge against their killer by attacking any adults in the pizzeria after-hours in
                blind rage. He was the pirate fox entertainer when the first Freddy Fazbear's Pizza was opened in 1983
                (although, it's unknown if he was discontinued). In 1987, he and the original animatronics had all fallen into
                severe disrepair and Foxy was replaced by his newer counterpart for the "improved" Freddy Fazbear's
                Pizza, Mangle.
